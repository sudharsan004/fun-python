FizzBuzz is a game in which we have to say the numbers like 1,2,... where if the number is divisible by 3 we have to say "Fizz"
if the number is divisible by 5 we have to say "Buzz" and if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 we have to say "Fizz-Buzz"
There are many ways in which we can code for this game, I have tried a few.
